Using netkey and the looopback feature, pluto connects to itself for an SA.
This is used for MLS type labeling of connections on the same host

This tests whether priorities are honoured properly when multiple loopback
connections are in use. We install a wide policy and check it is getting
encrypted. Then we install a narrow passthrough policy on top and see if
we properly send unencrypted
